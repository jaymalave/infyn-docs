This document illustrates **how a third-party vendor can integrate Infyn API** in two different product scenarios:

1.  Code-Review Bot for Software Teams
2.  AI Customer-Support Assistant for e-commerce

---

## 1 · Code-Review Bot Vendor

### Product vision

A SaaS company (e.g. _CodeRabbit_) offers an AI that reviews pull-requests, leaves inline comments, and chats with developers about code smells and style guidelines.

### How the vendor uses Infyn

| Step                        | Infyn endpoint                 | Purpose                                                                                                                                                       |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Install / onboarding**    | `POST /v1/api-key/generate`    | CodeRabbit generates a vendor-scoped key and stores it in their backend.                                                                                      |
| **User mapping**            | `POST /users`                  | Whenever a new developer logs in CodeRabbit, the backend creates a Infyn _internal user_ (one-to-one mapping).                                                |
| **Per-PR review chat**      | `POST /v2/chat`                | The PR diff is sent as the **user message**; `thread_id` is set to the PR number so all discussion stays threaded.                                            |
| **Fetch past advice**       | Implicit inside `process_chat` | Infyn retrieves relevant **memories** (e.g. past request to _not flag if-else statements_) and the developer's **user facts** (max line length, review tone). |
| **Persist assistant reply** | Automatic                      | The assistant's comments are chunked, stored as **memories**, and can be surfaced in later PRs.                                                               |

### Example timeline

1.  Developer Bob opens **PR-58** on the `analytics-service`. Bob is already mapped to Infyn (`user_id = "u-123"`).  
    • **User Facts** pulled: `preferred_language: rust`, `max_line_length: 120`, `review_tone: concise`.  
    • **Memories** pulled: the developer's request in **PR-44** to "stop flagging if-else statements" as style issues.

2.  CodeRabbit sends the diff to `/v2/chat`:

    ```json
    {
      "user_id": "u-123",
      "message": "<git-diff>",
      "thread_id": "pr-58"
    }
    ```

3.  Infyn replies with a structured review that clearly separates insights:

    - From **User Facts** → flags three lines over 120 characters and writes suggestions in a concise tone.
    - From **Memories** → skips flagging if-else statements, honoring Bob's request captured in **PR-44**.

4.  Bob replies: _"Let's cap my line length at 100 instead."_  
    → Infyn overwrites the user fact `max_line_length: 100` (facts are authoritative and mutable).

5.  When the PR is merged Infyn stores its final inline comments as new **memories** so future reviews can reference how the SQL-injection risk was fixed here (memories accumulate, never overwritten).

#### Benefits

- Review comments respect Bob's personal style prefs.
- Past advice is reused automatically; no re-inventing feedback.

## 2 · AI Customer-Support Assistant Vendor

### Product vision

_HelpDesk AI_ integrates into e-commerce sites, answering shoppers' questions, tracking order issues, and learning each shopper's preferences.

### How the vendor uses Infyn

| Step                              | Infyn endpoint                  | Purpose                                                                                       |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Account bootstrap**             | `/v1/api-key/generate`          | Vendor obtains an API key.                                                                    |
| **Shopper identification**        | `/users`                        | Each e-commerce user gets an internal Infyn `user_id`.                                        |
| **Live chat**                     | `/v2/chat` (streaming optional) | Customer messages ("Where is my order #A123?") are forwarded; assistant replies in real-time. |
| **Structured preference capture** | Automatic via `user_facts`      | Phrases like "I prefer express shipping" are turned into facts that override older ones.      |
| **Context retrieval**             | Automatic                       | On every chat, Infyn supplies:                                                                |

- Recent order conversations (memories)
- Stable facts (preferred payment method, usual sizes, allergies)

### Example timeline

1.  Shopper Emma starts a chat: _"My espresso machine (order #9123) arrived with a cracked carafe. Also, please send future deliveries to my office."_ (`user_id = "e-999"`).  
    • **User Facts** pulled: `preferred_shipping: express`, `default_address: home`, `allergies: peanuts`.  
    • **Memories** pulled: last month's conversation about a broken glass lid (order #9001).

2.  HelpDesk AI forwards the message to `/v2/chat` with `thread_id = "support-9123"`.

3.  Infyn composes a reply by combining both data sources:

    - From **Memories** → skips redundant troubleshooting steps because it recalls Emma already tried them for order #9001 and directly offers a replacement.
    - From **User Facts** → proposes an express replacement shipment to her **home** address (current default).

4.  Emma responds: _"Ship the replacement to my office and switch me to standard shipping."_  
    → Infyn overwrites `default_address: office` and `preferred_shipping: standard` inside **user facts**.

5.  Infyn confirms the updates and logs this conversation as a new **memory** so future agents see the context, while the updated shipping preferences live in **user facts** and are applied automatically next time.

#### Benefits

- Assistant maintains consistent, up-to-date profile facts (shipping, allergies).
- Episodic memories (past orders) improve answer relevance without bloating the prompt.

### Takeaways

- **Structured `user_facts`** keep the authoritative settings/minutiae small and fast.
- **Unstructured `memories`** capture the rich, ever-growing conversation and code history.
- Both vendors need only two core calls—`/users` and `/v2/chat`—to unlock personalised AI.
