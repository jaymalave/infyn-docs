## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For this documentation, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

<Card
  title='SuperMemory API Endpoints'
  icon='bolt'
  href='/api-reference/openapi.json'
>
  View the OpenAPI specification file
</Card>

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens as specified in the OpenAPI file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "BearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
